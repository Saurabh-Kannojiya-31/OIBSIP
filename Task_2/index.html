            <h2>UI/UX Designer and Web Developer</h2>
            <p>
                Hello Everyone!
                I am a passionate Web Developer and UI/UX Designer, with a strong focus on creating impactful and user-centric digital experiences. My journey began during my MCA studies, where I developed a keen interest in building interactive websites and intuitive user interfaces. Over time, I’ve worked on a variety of projects, from e-commerce platforms to dynamic web applications, constantly honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design.
                Through internships at companies like CodSoft, Prodigy InfoTech, and now Oasis Infobyte, I’ve gained hands-on experience in front-end and back-end development, as well as in UI/UX design. These experiences have allowed me to work on a range of tasks, including email template designs, mobile app sign-up flows, and responsive website development, helping me grow as a well-rounded developer.
                I’m always excited to collaborate on innovative projects that challenge my skills and push the boundaries of what’s possible in the digital world. My goal is to continue developing impactful designs that drive engagement and provide seamless user experiences.
                When I’m not coding, I enjoy stand-up comedy, sketching, and traveling, which keep my creative energy flowing. I am eager to contribute to forward-thinking teams and work on projects that create meaningful user interactions.
